## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to develop an AI-powered agent that can analyze public documentation articles from help.moengage.com and suggest improvements. Task 1 focuses on building the "Documentation Analyzer Agent" which takes a URL as input and outputs a structured list of actionable suggestions for improvement.

## Core Tasks Implemented

The agent analyzes articles based on the following criteria:

1.  **Readability for a Marketer**: Assesses content's readability for a non-technical marketer, explaining the assessment beyond just a score.
2.  **Structure and Flow**: Analyzes headings, subheadings, paragraph length, use of lists, and logical information flow.
3.  **Completeness of Information & Examples**: Checks if enough detail is provided for understanding and implementation, and suggests where examples could be added or improved.
4.  **Adherence to Style Guidelines (Simplified)**: Focuses on Voice and Tone (customer-focused, clear, concise), Clarity and Conciseness (simplifying complex sentences/jargon), and Action-oriented language. It identifies deviations and suggests specific changes.

The output is a structured report (JSON) containing the analyzed URL, a brief assessment for each criterion, and specific, actionable suggestions.

## Technical Guidelines Adhered To

* **Programming Language**: Python, primarily within Jupyter Notebooks.
* **LLMs**: Utilizes an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT models) via API for content analysis. The choice is configurable via environment variables within the notebooks.
* **Web Content Fetching**: Employs `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` to fetch and parse HTML content from given URLs.
* **No UI Focus**: The assignment is backend/agent-focused, so no time was spent on frontend or UI development.
* **Code Quality**: Emphasis on clear, well-commented, and organized code within the notebook cells.
